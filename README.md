This repository contains a measurement script based on QuMADA, a QCoDeS-based measurement framework used for data acquisition and handling, to facilitate experiments in quantum technology. It also includes the plotting scripts adapted from A. Sala and T. Offerman, which were used during my master's thesis on 'Characterization of a Design-Optimised Si/SiGe Single Electron Transistors for Quantum Chips' in the Experimental Quantum Technology group at RWTH Aachen University.
